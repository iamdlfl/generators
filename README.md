These are HTML/Javascript forms to be used in processing various transactions. This allows for greater consistency in making requests, provides assurance that all necessary information is provided, and saves time.

The forms are fairly self-explanatory. Note that there is an auto-exchange coded into the honorarium generator. This uses an API that allows for a few free transactions a day, please only use that feature when necessary. 

These were created and are maintained by David Lynch.
